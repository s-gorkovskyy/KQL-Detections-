# 🕵️‍♂️ KQL Detections & Hunting Queries

This repository is a collection of my **KQL (Kusto Query Language)** detections and hunting queries, primarily focused on the **Microsoft Defender XDR / Microsoft Sentinel** ecosystem.  
It’s a learning project where I share rules that I find useful, experiment with, and improve over time.

## 📌 About
- Focused on **endpoint and cloud detections** (Defender XDR, Sentinel).
- Queries often use **variables (`let`)** for clarity and reusability.
- Each detection includes notes about:
  - Why it was created
  - What it looks for
  - Potential noise / false positives
  - Suggested exclusions

I am still new in the field, so **feedback and contributions are very welcome** 🙌
